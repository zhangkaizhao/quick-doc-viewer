# TODO

* Support more formats e.g. AsciiDoc, reStructuredText, etc. (this requires related libraries in pure Rust)

  - reStructuredText: [rst] does not have complete implementation of the reStructuredText specification
  - AsciiDoc: there are no implementation of the AsciiDoc specitification in pure Rust

* Cache for converted html from Markdown, etc.

* Better UI for page

* Tests

* Markdown: text between front matter delimiters as metadata (maybe)

* Command line arguments or configuration file (maybe)

* Distribution as GUI application using Tauri or Flutter (maybe)
